# GraphQL Testing API - AI Development Context

## Project Overview
Built a comprehensive GraphQL API in Node.js with TypeScript for security testing purposes. The application includes a complete vehicle and parking management system with JWT-based authentication.

## Key Decisions Made

### Technology Stack
- **Runtime**: Node.js 18 with TypeScript
- **GraphQL**: Apollo Server with TypeGraphQL for schema-first development
- **Authentication**: JWT with bcrypt for password hashing
- **Package Manager**: Yarn as requested
- **Containerization**: Docker & Docker Compose for easy deployment
- **Database**: In-memory data store for testing (PostgreSQL configured for future use)

### Architecture Decisions
1. **TypeGraphQL**: Chosen for type-safe GraphQL schema generation with decorators
2. **In-Memory Data Store**: Used for simplicity in testing environment, with PostgreSQL ready for production
3. **JWT Authentication**: Implemented with middleware for request context
4. **Input Validation**: Class-validator for GraphQL input validation
5. **Security Middleware**: Helmet, CORS, and custom auth middleware

### Data Models Implemented
1. **User**: Authentication and role management
2. **Vehicle**: Multiple types (CAR, MOTORCYCLE, TRUCK, VAN) with fuel types
3. **ParkingSlot**: Different slot types and statuses
4. **VehicleRevision**: Maintenance tracking with various revision types

### Security Features
- JWT-based authentication
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Role-based authorization (USER/ADMIN)
- Input validation and sanitization
- CORS protection
- Security headers with Helmet

### Docker Setup
- Multi-service Docker Compose configuration
- PostgreSQL database service
- Redis for future caching
- Adminer for database management
- Proper networking and volume management

## Development Notes

### Challenges Encountered
1. **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Had to handle exactOptionalPropertyTypes properly
2. **JWT Types**: Some type issues with JWT library that were resolved
3. **GraphQL Schema**: Proper typing for input/output types with TypeGraphQL

### Testing Considerations
The application is designed as a security testing benchmark with:
- Multiple authentication flows
- Complex data relationships
- Various input validation scenarios
- CRUD operations on all entities
- GraphQL introspection enabled

### Default Data
Pre-configured users for testing:
- Admin: admin@test.com / admin123
- User: user@test.com / user123

## Future Enhancements
- Database integration (PostgreSQL)
- Rate limiting
- Advanced authorization rules
- Caching with Redis
- Unit and integration tests
- API documentation with GraphQL Playground

## Files Created
- Complete TypeScript GraphQL API
- Docker and Docker Compose configuration
- Comprehensive README with API documentation
- Environment configuration
- Security middleware and utilities

## Final Status
âœ… **Project Successfully Completed**

### What Works:
- âœ… GraphQL API with JWT authentication
- âœ… All CRUD operations for Users, Vehicles, Parking Slots, and Vehicle Revisions
- âœ… TypeScript compilation and build process
- âœ… Docker containerization
- âœ… Development server with hot reload
- âœ… Health check endpoints
- âœ… Security middleware and authentication
- âœ… In-memory data store with sample data

## Security Testing Modifications
ðŸ”“ **Broken User Authentication (BUA) Vulnerabilities Introduced**

### Vulnerabilities Added:

#### GraphQL Endpoints (Bypassed Authentication):
- **User Data Exposure**: `users` query accessible without authentication
- **Vehicle Data Exposure**: `vehicles` query accessible without authentication  
- **Parking Slot Exposure**: `parkingSlots` query accessible without authentication
- **Vehicle Revision Exposure**: `vehicleRevisions` query accessible without authentication
- **User Profile Exposure**: `user` query accessible without authentication
- **Vehicle Creation Bypass**: `createVehicle` mutation accessible without authentication
- **Parking Slot Creation Bypass**: `createParkingSlot` mutation accessible without authentication

#### REST Endpoints (No Authentication):
- **`/api/users`**: Exposes all user data without authentication
- **`/api/vehicles`**: Exposes all vehicle data without authentication

#### Authentication Middleware Vulnerabilities:
- **Invalid Token Acceptance**: Any malformed token is accepted as valid
- **Default User Assignment**: Invalid tokens get assigned anonymous user role
- **authChecker Bypass**: Always returns true, bypassing all authentication checks

### Testing Scenarios:
These vulnerabilities allow automated tests to detect BUA by comparing:
- Authenticated vs unauthenticated responses
- Valid vs invalid JWT tokens
- Empty vs malformed authentication headers
- REST vs GraphQL endpoint access patterns

### Expected Test Results:
- Same sensitive data returned regardless of authentication status
- No authorization checks in vulnerable endpoints
- Identical responses for authenticated and unauthenticated requests
- REST endpoints expose sensitive data without any authentication

### Test Results Confirmed:
âœ… REST endpoints `/api/users` and `/api/vehicles` expose sensitive data without authentication
âœ… GraphQL queries return same data regardless of authentication status
âœ… Invalid tokens are accepted and processed
âœ… Authentication bypass works across all vulnerable endpoints
âœ… **Stream not readable issue SOLVED** by disabling Apollo's body parser and using Express's body parser first

### Technical Issues Resolved:
1. **Stream not readable error**: Fixed by configuring Apollo Server with `bodyParserConfig: false`
2. **Body parser order**: Moved Express body parser to the very beginning
3. **GraphQL queries**: Now working perfectly with BUA vulnerabilities active

### Default Users:
- Admin: `admin@test.com` / `admin123`
- User: `user@test.com` / `user123`

### Access Points:
- API: http://localhost:4000
- GraphQL Playground: http://localhost:4000/graphql
- Health Check: http://localhost:4000/health

### Docker Commands:
```bash
# Build and run with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d

# Build Docker image
docker build -t yagta .

# Run locally
yarn dev
```

### Issues Resolved:
1. âœ… TypeGraphQL authChecker requirement
2. âœ… JWT token generation (using hardcoded '24h' for simplicity)
3. âœ… TypeScript strict mode compatibility
4. âœ… Missing graphql-scalars dependency
5. âœ… Docker build and containerization
6. âœ… Stream not readable error (Apollo body parser conflict)

## Traffic Generation Scripts

### Purpose:
Generate comprehensive traffic against all GraphQL operations and REST endpoints with valid authentication tokens to help API discovery tools identify all available endpoints and detect BUA vulnerabilities.

### Available Scripts:
1. **`quick-test.sh`**: Fast verification of all endpoints with basic testing
2. **`generate-traffic.js`**: Complete testing of all GraphQL operations and REST endpoints
3. **`continuous-traffic.js`**: Ongoing traffic generation for long-term API discovery
4. **`TRAFFIC_GENERATION.md`**: Complete documentation for all scripts

### Script Features:
- **Authentication Testing**: Tests with no token, user token, and admin token
- **Complete Coverage**: All GraphQL queries and mutations tested
- **REST Endpoints**: All available REST endpoints tested
- **BUA Verification**: Confirms vulnerabilities by comparing authenticated vs unauthenticated responses
- **API Discovery Ready**: Generates traffic patterns for security tools to analyze

### Usage:
```bash
# Quick test
yarn test:quick

# Comprehensive traffic generation
yarn test:traffic

# Continuous traffic generation
yarn test:continuous
```

### Tested Operations:
- **Authentication**: Login, Register
- **User Operations**: Get all users, Get user by ID, Get current user
- **Vehicle Operations**: Get all vehicles, Get vehicle by ID, Get my vehicles, Create/Update/Delete vehicle
- **Parking Slot Operations**: Get all parking slots, Get parking slot by ID, Get my parking slots, Create/Update/Delete parking slot
- **Vehicle Revision Operations**: Get all revisions, Get revision by ID, Get revisions by vehicle, Create/Update/Delete revision
- **REST Endpoints**: All available REST endpoints
